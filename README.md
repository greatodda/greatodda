- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Omesh Dhar Dwivedi. I am currently a first year PhD student at Drexel University working at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. 
- I enjoy competitive debating, chess, squash, water polo, watching anime/kdrama and oil painting among many other things. I have recently restarted writing poetry. 
- Here is my favorite quote which is a poem called 'Tachi' from hyakunin isshu. 
- Tachi wakare 
Inaba no yama no 
Mine ni oru 
Matsu to shi kikaba 
Ima kaeri kon 



-Though we are apart,
If on Mount Inabaâ€™s peak
I should hear the sound
Of the pine trees growing there,
I will return to you
